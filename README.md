This is my UX design portfolio, based on http://hits.dwyl.io/rbhatia46/React-Portfolio, rigth now it is a simple single page app, but I would like make another "template" page similar to the home page that specificaly for my projects.

That will require routing with react, something I know can't be too complicated, but I just dont have the time to figure it out.

These tiles on the first page just need to link to the project pages. 

Those project pages will have these componates (all of which already exist)

+ Hero with BG image and h1
+ Pin board with skills/methods used on the project
+ Simple Repeatable content section with an image and text
+ portfolio section

Here's an example of what I want the page to look like in HTML/PHP/CSS
